better file system
similar to ext 4 we just format partition in btrfs

generally only one partition is created.
but multiple can be created

commands:
https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SysadminGuide#Snapshots
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs#Snapshots

firmat: mkfs.btrfs -L "ROOT" "/dev/sda2" -f
creating subvolumes:
these are like folders which act like virtual partitions that can be mounted.(meaning linked(accessed) from that mount point.)

in ext4 generally to separate the home parition a separate parition is created but in btrfs a subvolume can do the job.

so, multiple subvolumes for each partition are created 
root subvolume is created at @: btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@
home at @home : btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@home

generally these two are sufficient but we can also create:
@var: btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@var
@snapshots btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@snapshots 

these subvols are then mounted by creating folders in the @
order is important:
mount -o noatime,compress=lzo,space_cache,subvol=@ /dev/sda2 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/{boot,home,var,.snapshots}
mount -o noatime,compress=lzo,space_cache,subvol=@home /dev/sda2 /mnt/home
mount -o noatime,compress=lzo,space_cache,subvol=@var /dev/sda2 /mnt/var
mount -o noatime,compress=lzo,space_cache,subvol=@snapshots /dev/sda2 /mnt/.snapshots


note boot cannot be btrfs (only fat32)




xorg:
this draws the screen .

xorg->sddm/lightdm->desktop environment 

xorg interfaces with the driver(intel/nvidia)
by default the xorg.conf file is not needed

two ways to fix these driver issues:

reconfigure the Xorg

X -configure generates a xorg.conf file move it to /etc/x11 and rerun the nvidia-xconfig


sddm | gdm | lightdm

GDM, GNOME implementation
SDDM, recommended display manager for KDE Plasma 5 and LXQt. Successor to KDM.
LightDM, a lightweight, modular, cross-desktop, fully themeable desktop display manager by Canonical Ltd.

nvidia:

creating hooks in grub helps the user to use multiple linux kernals

linux cant manage nvidia drivers when they are passed through intel drivers

linux can manage:
intel integrated graphics -> display
nvidia gpu -> display (dedicated gpu)

linux cant manage:
if they are non switchable then linux cant handle.

cheap laptops dont have mux to switch the graphics
nvidia gpu -> intel gpu -> display

this leads to os unable to launch the nvidia-settings
this wont load nvidia driver as well
